poly
====

A repository for the documentation of a school project.

Compiling
=========

To compile the file doc.tex into doc.pdf use pdflatex inside documentation/. 
  Linux:
    > pdflatex doc.tex 
  Windows (MikTeX+bash):
    > pdflatex.exe doc.tex

Images
======

Images are placed inside documentation/img/ as pdf files. Preferably
only vector graphics. To create vector graphics use e.g. Inkscape
and/or Dia. The former is extremely flexible graphics software with
somewhat steep learning curve and the latter is good mainly for
creating diagrams and is kind of an open source version of Office
Visio.

Source Code
===========

All the source code should go in source/ in a proper, descriptive
subdirectory.
